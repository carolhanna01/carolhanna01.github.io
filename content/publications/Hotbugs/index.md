abstract: Hot fixes are urgent, unplanned changes deployed to production systems to address time-critical issues. Despite their importance, no existing evaluation benchmark focuses specifically on hot fixes. We present HotBugsjar, the first dataset dedicated to real-world hot fixes. From an initial mining of 10 active Apache projects totaling over 190K commits and 150K issue reports, we identified 746 software patches that met our hot-fix criteria. After manual evaluation, 679 were confirmed as genuine hot fixes, of which 110 are reproducible using a test suite. Building upon the Bugsjar framework, HotBugsjar integrates these 110 reproducible cases and makes available all 679 manually validated hot fixes, each enriched with comprehensive metadata to support future research. Each hot fix was systematically identified using Jira issue data, validated by independent reviewers, and packaged in a reproducible format with buggy and fixed versions, test suites, and metadata. HotBugsjar has already been adopted as the official challenge dataset for the Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) Conference Challenge Track, demonstrating its immediate impact. This benchmark enables the study and evaluation of tools for rapid debugging, automated repair, and production-grade resilience in modern software systems to drive research in this essential area forward.
